please check the component's own documentation page.

## Build

The readable version of this documentation can be generated by means of sphinx. In order to
do so, please follow the steps below. Those are actually based off
[Read The Docs own documentation](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

```shell
> pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx-intl
> make html

```

For that to work, you must have pip installed on the machine used to build the documentation.
To install pip on an ubuntu machine:

```shell
> sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

To build the documentation in Brazilian Portuguese language, run the following extra commands:

```shell
> sphinx-intl -c source/conf.py build -d source/locale
> make html BUILDDIR=build/html-pt_BR O='-d build/doctrees/ -D language=pt_BR'
```

## Update workflow

To update the documentation, follow the steps below:

1. Update the source files for the english version
2. Extract translatable messages from the english version

```shell
> make gettext
```

3. Update the message catalog (PO Files) for pt_BR language

```shell
> sphinx-intl -c source/conf.py update -p build/gettext -l pt_BR
```

4. Translate the messages in the pt_BR language PO files 

This workflow is based on the [internationalization feature of Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html).

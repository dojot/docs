Architecture
============

This document describes the current architecture that guides the platform
implementation, detailing the components that comprise the solution, as well as
their functionalities and how each of them contribute to the platform as a
whole.

While a brief explanation of each component is provided, this high level
description does not explain (or aims to explain) the minutiae of each
component's implementation. For that, please refer to each component's own
documentation.

Components
----------

Dojot was designed to make fast solution prototyping possible, providing a
platform that's easy to use, scalable and robust. Its internal architecture
makes use of many well-known open-source components with others designed and
implemented by dojot team.

Using dojot is as follows: a user configures IoT devices through the GUI or
directly using the REST APIs provided by the API Gateway. Data processing flows
might be also configured - these entities can perform a variety of actions,
such as generate notifications when a particular device attribute reaches a
certain threshold or save all data generated by a device onto an external
database. As devices start sending their readings to dojot, a user can:

- receive these readings in real time by socket.io channels;
- consolidate all data into virtual devices;
- gather all data from historical database, and so on.

These features can be used through REST APIs - these are the basic building
blocks that any application based on dojot should use. dojot GUI provides an
easy way to perform management operations for all entities related to the
platform (users, devices, templates and flows) and can also be used to check if
everything is working fine.

The user contexts are isolated and there are no data sharing, the access
credentials are validated by the authorization service for each and every
operation (API Request). Therefore, a user belonging to a particular context
(tenant) cannot reach any data (including devices, templates, flows or any
other data related to these resources) from other ones.

Once devices are configured, the IoT Agent is capable of mapping the data
received from devices, encapsulated on MQTT for example, and send them to the
message broker for internal distribution. This way, the data reaches the
persistence service, for instance, so it can persist the data on a database.

For more information about what's going on with dojot, you should take a look
at `dojot GitHub repository <https://github.com/dojot>`_. There you'll find all
components used in dojot.

Each one of the components that are part of the architecture are briefly
described on the sub-sections below.

Kafka + DataBroker
******************

Apache Kafka is a distributed messaging platform that can be used by
applications which need to stream data or consume/produce data pipelines. In
comparison with other open-source messaging solutions, Kafka seems to be more
appropriate to fulfil *dojot*'s architectural requirements (responsibility
isolation, simplicity, and so on).

In Kafka, a specialized topics structure is used to insure isolation between
different users and applications data, enabling a multi-tenant infrastructure.

The DataBroker service makes use of an in-memory database for efficiency. It
adds context to Apache Kafka, making it possible that internal or even external
services are able to consume real-time data based on context. DataBroker is
also a distributed service to avoid it being a single point of failure or even
a bottleneck for the architecture.

DeviceManager
*************

DeviceManager is a core entity which is responsible for keeping devices and
templates data models. It is also responsible for publishing any updates to all
interested components through Kafka.

This service is stateless, having its data persisted to a database, with data
isolation for users and applications, making possible a multi-tenant
architecture for the middleware.

IoT Agent
*********

An IoT agent is an adaptation service between physical devices and *dojot's*
core components. It could be understood as a *device driver* for a set of
devices. The *dojot* platform can have multiple iot-agents, each one of them
being specialized in a specific protocol like, for instance, MQTT/JSON,
CoAP/LWM2M, Lora/ATC, Sigfox/WDN and HTTP/JSON.

It is also responsible to ensure that it communicates with devices using secure
channels.


User Authorization Service
**************************

This service is responsible for managing user profiles and access control.
Basically any API call that reaches the platform via the API Gateway is
validated by this service.

To be able to deal with a high volume of authorization calls, it uses caching,
it is stateless and it is scalable horizontally. Its data is stored on a
database.

Flowbroker (Flow builder)
*************************

This service provides mechanisms to build data processing flows to perform a
set of actions. These flows can be extended using external processing blocks
(which can be added using REST APIs).

Data Manager
************

This service manages the dojot's data **configuration**,
making possible to import and export configuration
like templates, devices and flows.

Cron
****

Cron is a dojot's microservice that  allows you to schedule events to be emitted - or requests to be sent - to other microservices inside dojot platform.


Kafka2Ftp
*********

The kafka2ftp service provides a connector solution for
forwarding messages from Apache Kafka to FTP servers.
It subscribes to the topic ``tenant.dojot.ftp``
(*tenant* is defined in the environment variable).
In these topics there are messages with information about the file name,
encoding format and file content,
these messages are published by some service or
the `Publish in FTP topic` node from Flowbroker.


Persister/History
*****************

The Persister component works as a pipeline for data and events that must be
persisted on a database. The data is converted into a storage structure and is
sent to the corresponding database.

For internal storage, the MongoDB non-relational database is being used, it
allows a Sharded Cluster configuration that may be required according to the
use case.

The persisted data can be queried through a Rest API provided by the History microservice.

Kong API Gateway
****************

The Kong API Gateways is used as the entry point for applications and external
services to reach the services that are internal to the dojot platform,
resulting in multiple advantages like, for instance, single access point and
ease when applying rules over the API calls like traffic rate limitation and
access control.

GUI
***

The Graphical User Interface in *dojot* is responsible for providing responsive
interfaces to manage the platform, including functionalities like:

* **User Profile Management**: Define profiles and the API permission
  associated to those profiles
* **User Management**: Creation, Visualization, Edition and Deletion Operations
* **Templates Management**: Creation, Visualization, Edition and Deletion
  Operations
* **Devices Management**: Creation, Visualization (real time data), Edition and
  Deletion Operations
* **Processing Flows Management**: Creation, Visualization, Edition and
  Deletion Operations
* **Notifications**: View system notifications (unified real time and history)

Image manager
*************

This component is responsible for device (firmware) image storage and retrieval.
It is used by the firmware update mechanism.

X.509 Identity Management
*************************

This component is responsible for assigning identities to devices, such
identities are represented in the form of `x.509`_ certificates. It behaves
similarly to a *Certificate Authority* (`CA`_), where it is possible to submit a
`CSR`_ and receive a certificate back.
Once the certificate has been installed on the device, it is possible to
communicate securely with the dojot platform, as the data collected by the
device is transmitted over a secure (encrypted) channel and it is also possible
to guarantee the integrity of the data.

Infrastructure
--------------

A few extra components are used in dojot,they are:

- postgres: this database is used to persist data from many components, such as
  Device Manager.

- redis: in-memory database used as cache in many components, such as service
  orchestrator, subscription manager, IoT agents, and so on. It is very light
  and easy to use.

- rabbitMQ: message broker used in service orchestrator in order to implement
  action flows related that should be applied to messages received from
  components.

- mongo database: widely used database solution that is easy to use and doesn't
  add a considerable access overhead (where it was employed in dojot).

- zookeeper: keeps replicated services within a cluster under control.


Communications
--------------

All components communicate with each other in two ways:

- Using HTTP requests: if one component needs to retrieve data from other one,
  say an IoT agent needs the list of currently configured devices from Device
  Manager, it can send a HTTP request to the appropriate component.

- Using Kafka messages: if one component needs to send new information about a
  resource controlled by it (such as new devices created in Device Manager),
  the component may publish this data through Kafka. Using this mechanism, any
  other component that is interested in such information needs only to listen
  to a particular topic to receive it. Note that this mechanism doesn't make
  any hard associations between components. For instance, Device Manager
  doesn't know which components need its information, and an IoT agent doesn't
  need to know which component is sending data through a particular topic.

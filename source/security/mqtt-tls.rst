tl;dr
-----

For a device to connect using TLS with Mosquitto, it must possess:

-  A key pair (.key file);
-  A certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) trusted by
   Mosquitto (.crt file);
-  The certificate of this CA (.crt file);
-  An entry on Mosquitto Access Control List (ACL), allowing the device
   to publish on a specific topic;
-  (optional) A Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

When a device is created, DeviceManager will automatically notify
the following components:

-  IoTAgent: will register the new device on its internal cache.
-  MQTT-Manager: will create an entry on the ACL, allowing the device to
   publish on a specific topic.
-  EJBCA: will create an end entity so a certificate can be created on
   the future.

By default, dojot uses clear MQTT. To activate TLS, docker-compose.yml must be
changed:

-  The image for service 'mqtt' must be changed from 'ansi/mosquitto' to
   'dojot/mqtt-manager';
-  The public port for 'mqtt' service must be changed from '1883:1883' to
   '8883:8883';
-  The MQTT\_TLS variable of 'iotagent' service must be set to true (lowercase).

On the configuration file 'iotagent/config.json':

-  The flag 'secure' should be changed to true

Components
----------

EJBCA-REST
~~~~~~~~~~

`EJBCA`_ is a complete Private Key Infrastructure (PKI) capable to manage CAs,
cryptography keys and certificates. EJBCA provides a SOAP, web and a command
line interface. EJBCA-REST is an wrapper on top of EJBCA that provides modern
interfaces, like REST and Kafka.

EJBCA provides SOAP, web and command line interfaces. EJBCA-REST is a wrapper
on top of EJBCA that complements those, allowing the CA to be configured using
REST. When used within dojot, it also listens to Kafka events, allowing its
automatic configuration.

What is a certificate?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A certificate contains the public key for an entity (a user, device, website),
along with information about this entity, about the CA which signs the
certificate, the allowed certificate usage and a checksum. When a entity wants
a certificate to be signed, the entity should create a CSR file and send it to
the desired CA. The CSR file is an 'intention of certification'. The file
contains the information required from the entity and some information about
the certificate use, hostnames and IPs where the certificate will reside,
alternative names for the entity, etc. EJBCA can decide, using its configured
policies, what information to keep, to discard and to overwrite of the received
CSR. EJBCA can refuse to sign a CSR if it concludes that it is not safe enough
according to its policies.

These configurable policies are called 'Certificate Profiles'. One Certificate
profile named CFREE, specialized for MQTT TLS, is provided out of the box.

In short, CFREE have the following configurations (and many more):

-  Cryptography keys must have between 2048 and 8192 bits;
-  Certificate expires in 730 days;
-  Entities can define hostnames and IPs;
-  Key usage is marked as not critical (for now);
-  The hash algorithm is SHA256. The sign algorithm is RSA.

I have a CSR. How can I ask EJBCA to sign it for me?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calm down! EJBCA will not allow strangers to ask for certification. You need to
authenticate yourself. EJBCA use a username+password authentication system. The
term 'end entity' will be used to refer to EJBCA users to follow the terms on
EJBCA documentation and to avoid ambiguities between EJBCA users and dojot
users. An administrator should create the end entity. An entity that was just
created has the state 'New' an can generate a certificate. After signing a
certificate for an entity, the end entity's state changes to 'Generated' and
will no longer accept this username and password. EJBCA 'End entities' can
create only one certificate.

So, how does EJBCA work in dojot?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When creating a new device, an associated end entity is created in EJBCA. Its
name will be the device's ID (like '8fa3') and its password will be always
'dojot'.

A certificate can be signed by sending a HTTP POST request to
host:1234/sign/<cname>/pkcs10. CName is the end entity's name (or device). The
payload sent with this request should be a JSON containing the end entity
password and a CSR file (certificate intention) in base64 format.

Note that the URL is 'routed' by the API gateway. As in other APIs in dojot, a
JWT is needed. You can find how to generate and how to use such token in `User
Guide`_.

In order to create the CSR file and ask for a certificate signature, a user can
use a helper script called 'Certificate Retriever', which is detailed in
`Certificate retriever`_ section.

MQTT Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MQTT-Manager is a helper service used to configure Mosquitto MQTT broker in a
simple and 'on-the-fly' way. It can be configured using REST interfaces and
Kakfa. Thus, HTTP requests or Kafka messages can be used to create and remove
devices, as well as update CRL file (certification revocation list). This
service is distributed as a docker container for easy deploy and its source
code repository can be accessed in `MQTT Manager repository`_.

Mosquitto by itself doesn't generate nor revoke certificates, it only relies on
a CA and implements TLS protocol. The 'creation' of a particular device
consists only in adding a new rule to ACL file in Mosquitto. Such file looks
like:

.. code:: ini

    user iotagent
    topic read /#
    user 24f6
    topic write /admin/24f6/attrs

Each rule is composed by two lines: the first one specifies the user (device)
and the second one defines which action (write or read) is allowed to which
topic. In the example above, the user iotagent can read all topics (# is a
wildcard). Also, the device with ID 24f6 can write to topic /admin/24f6/attrs.
The device ID is retrieved in 'Common name' certificate field.

If a device sends data to a topic which it has no write permissions, then all
data is discarded. Mosquitto won't log any errors related to this.

When the ACL is changes, Mosquitto must be restarted (or a SIGDUP signal can be
sent to its process). MQTT-Manager does this automatically when creating or
removing devices.

A script is executed when firing the container up. This script will generate a
pair of keys to Mosquitto, retrieves the certificate and CRL from a CA and asks
it to sign its public key. ALl generated files are placed in
/usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs (inside the container).

Mosquitto will only accept device connections that have certificate signed by
its trusty CA.

Also note that MQTT-Manager is used only in case when a TLS-enabled broker is
needed. If this is not the case, then the vanilla `Mosquitto docker image`_ can
be used.

Mosquitto configuration files
-----------------------------

Checkout this commented Mosquitto configuration file:

.. code:: ini

    # network port on which Mosquitto will accept new connections
    port 8883

    # Trusted CA certificate
    cafile /usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs/ca.crt

    # Mosquitto certificate
    certfile /usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs/mosquitto.crt

    # Mosquitto key par
    keyfile /usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs/mosquitto.key

    tls_version tlsv1.2

    # If false, a device will check Mosquitto certificate, but Mosquitto won't check
    # the device counterparts.
    # If true, both checks are performed (2-way TLS)
    require_certificate true

    # Certificate Common Name field will be used as username.
    # Thus, a device with 'CN=abc1' will have a 'user abc1' entry in Mosquitto's ACL
    use_identity_as_username true

    # Permission list file
    acl_file /usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs/access.acl

    # CA CRL.
    crlfile /usr/local/src/mosquitto-1.4.13/certs/ca.crl

Note that for all configuration updates, it is mandatory to restart
Mosquitto or to send a SIGDUP signal to its process.

Certificate retriever
---------------------

This component is a helper script for device certificates creation. It
is available at `Certificate Retriever GitHub repository`_ and it
coded using Python 3.

A user can use it by executing:

.. code:: bash

    ./certificate-retriever.py HOST DEVICE-NAME CA [OPTIONS]

The mandatory parameters are:

-  HOST: where dojot is. Example: http://localhost:8000
-  DEVICE-NAME: device name that will get a new certificate. Example:
   ac32
-  CA: CA which will sign the certificate. Example: IOTmidCA (this is
   the CA name used in dojot)

Other options are:

-  -u or --username USERNAME: dojot's username. If this parameter is not
   specified here, it will be asked iteratively.
-  -w or --overwrite: overwrites any certificate files or criptographic
   keys if already existent.
-  -k or --key KEYLENGTH: size of the criptographic key being generated
   (in bits).
-  -d or --dns: Hostname where the certificate owner can be reached out.
   Note that this has no relation with DNS (Domain Name System) servers
   - this name was kept because x509 certificates have an attribute that
   is called DNS.
-  -i or --ip: same as -d, buto to specify IP address.
-  --skip-https-check: if dojot accepts HTTPS connections but it has no
   valid certificate, then this option will allow the connection to be
   made.

Note that authentication is performed in dojot. The script will ask for user
credentials and will invoke user authentication automatically. The user needs
permission for certificate signing to be able to use this script.

An end entity must exist in EJBCA in 'New' state before asking for a new
certificate signature. When a new device is created, an end entity is
automatically created in EJBCA by DeviceManager. This new end entity's name is
the device ID itself. Its password is 'dojot'.

The script authenticates users with given username and password, retrieves CA
certificate, generates a key pair as well as a CSR file and asks for
certificate signature, in this order. Any error in any step will halt its
execution.

After successfully executed, all certificates can be found in './certs'
folder.

Important Notes
---------------

These are a few but important notes related to device security and
associated subjects.

CRL (Certification Revocation List)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A CRL is a list which contains all revoked certificates. It is used to indicate
which certificates are no longer valid (administratively set to invalid) as a
normal certificate can be used for 1 to 5 years. This list is signed by CA and
also has an expiration date - 1 day by default. In TLS protocol, if CRL is
expired then the recommended action to be taken is to refuse all incoming
connections, as there is no way to check if the certificates used in those
connections are invalid or not. This procedure is implemented in Mosquitto.

Therefore, CA must generate a new list periodically. All components that use it
must be updated.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

TLS errors might be not so verbose as other problems. If an error occurrs, the
user might not know what went wrong because no component indicates any problem.
In this section there are some tips, frequent problems and debugging tools to
find out what's happening.

How to read a certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A certificate file can be in two formats: PEM (base64 text) or DER
(binary). OpenSSL offers tools to read such formats:

.. code:: bash

    openssl x509 -noout -text -in certFile.crt

To read a CRL:

.. code:: bash

    openssl crl -inform PEM -text -noout -in crlFile.crl

Errors in secure connection handshake between device and Mosquitto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If any errors occur during connection handshake, something like the
following error might appear in Mosquitto's logs:

.. code:: text

    1514550332: New connection from 172.20.0.1 on port 8883.
    1514550332: OpenSSL Error: error:140940E5:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:ssl handshake failure

If this happens, try to establish connection using 'openssl client', as
it is more verbose in error description.

.. code:: bash

    openssl s_client -connect localhost:8883 -CAfile ca.crt -cert device.crt -key device.key

Common errors are shown by openssl\_client (and \_server as well):

-  SSL alert number 45: this error indicates that a certificate expired.
   Keep in mind that CRL also expires.
-  SSL alert number 48: received a valid certificate chain or partial
   chain, but the certificate was not accepted because the CA
   certificate could not be located or could not be matched with a
   known, trusted CA. This message is always fatal.
-  Alert unknown CA: check whether sent CA certificate is correct. If it
   is a sub-CA, check if all of its certificate chain was sent. This
   error also occurs if the CA certificate data (specially common name
   attribute) is the same as those from client certificate.

Handshake is OK, but no published data reaches iotagent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can check whether the device could connect to MQTT broker by
checking Mosquitto's log:

::

    1514482004: New client connected from 172.20.0.10 as mqttjs_c011c22d (c1, k10, u'deviceName')

If that line shows up, it means that the TLS handshake worked and the device
successfully connected to Mosquitto. Check if the device has an ACL entry in
Mosquitto to allow it to publish data in the specified topic. Keep in mind that
if a device publishes something in another topic (which it has no permission to
publish) all data is discarded by Mosquitto with no warnings.

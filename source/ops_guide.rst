.. _deployment:

Deployment
----------

**TODO:** This section should describe the steps required to deploy the solution on all "homologated" environments
(e.g. standalone, aws, google cloud, bluemix, etc.). For each environment, there'll also be a link
pointing to the environment-specific section of the :ref:`resourceManagement` sub-section that describes
how cloud resources are managed (allocated, released and pertinent configuration).

.. _deviceManagement:

Device Management
-----------------

**TODO:** This section should describe the steps required to configure a new device on the platform. While this
information will also be presented on the user guide, here the idea is to give more focus to the
specific infrastructure that has to be managed in order to guarantee the device's authenticity and
communication.

.. _userManagement:

User Management
---------------

**TODO:** This section should describe the steps required to configure user roles and role permissions for the
platform itself, as well as handle application authentication features.

.. _resourceManagement:

Resources Management
--------------------

**TODO:** For each "homologated" deployment scenario, this section should describe how the deployment is done,
as well as which parameters are available for each of them.

.. _systemDashboard:

System Dashboard
----------------

**TODO:** This should be a brief description of the system dashboard that is made available for the system
administrator to check the system's overall status and alerts.

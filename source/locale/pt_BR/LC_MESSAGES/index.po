"This is the high-level documentation for dojot IoT platform developed by "
"CPqD. This platform is largely based on [FIWARE](fiware.org), and aims to"
" provide the application and device developers with a more concise and "
"integrated interaction, while benefiting for the highly customizable and "
"efficient infrastructure provided by FIWARE."

"While based on FIWARE, this platform actually has a large set of "
"components of its own, and interaction between components was modified to"
" allow better packaging and performance for the solution as a whole."

"While this does provide an overall glimpse of the platform, this "
"documentation is not suited for middleware developers that might want to "
"better understand the components that compose the solution themselves. "
"For that, please check the component's own documentation repositories and"
" ReadTheDocs pages."

#~ " that:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Use one of the available IoT "
#~ "agents: currently, there is support for"
#~ " MQTT-based devices. If your project"
#~ " is using (or allows changing to) "
#~ "this protocol, then it would suffice "
#~ "to check if the device is sending"
#~ " its data using a simple key/value"
#~ " JSON. If it isn't, then you "
#~ "might want to use iotagent-mosca "
#~ "(check `iotagent-mosca`_ documentation to "
#~ "check out how to do that). If "

#~ "Create a new IoT agent to support"

#~ "The scenario we'll build in this "

#~ " all associated packages. The association"
#~ " could be done by the vehicule "
#~ "itself - each time a new device"
#~ " is registered by its RFID scanners,"
#~ " it sends a message to dojot "
#~ "indicating that the device is now "

#~ "be processed by a new software "
#~ "component (to be developed in this "
#~ "tutorial) that performs this association, "
#~ "as currently there is no module "
#~ "responsible for \"device associations\". When"

#~ " For this tutorial we will send "
#~ "MQTT messages by hand to the "
#~ "platform, emulating such physical device. "
#~ "For that, we will use mosquitto_pub "
#~ "from Mosquitto project."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Some Linux distributions, Ubuntu in "

#~ "subscribing to topics) and another one"
#~ " containing the MQTT broker. In this"

#~ "MQTT broker is not running before "
#~ "starting dojot (by running commands like"
#~ " ``ps aux | grep mosquitto``)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The default message format used by "

#~ "topics:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "You can set the device ID that "
#~ "originates the message using the "
#~ "``client-id`` MQTT parameter. It should "
#~ "follow the following pattern: "
#~ "``<service>:<deviceid>``, such as ``admin:efac``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If you can't do such thing, then"
#~ " the device should set its ID "
#~ "using the topic used to publish "
#~ "messages. The topic should assume the"
#~ " pattern ``/<service-id>/<device-id>/attrs`` "
#~ "(for instance: ``/admin/efac/attrs``)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If you do define a topic in "
#~ "device template, then your device should"
#~ " publish its data to it and set"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "MQTT payload must be a JSON with"
#~ " each key being an attribute of "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "In order to check all values that"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This section will show how to "

#~ "will show how to add two "
#~ "thermometers and a virtual device that"
#~ " will represent an alarm system that"
#~ " will monitor both sensors."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As described in :ref:`Concepts`, all "
#~ "devices are based on a template. "
#~ "To create one, you should access "
#~ "the template tab at the left and"
#~ " then create one new template, as "
#~ "shown below."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Now we have one template from "
#~ "which devices can be \"instantiated\". "
#~ "All devices based on it will "
#~ "accept messages via MQTT that are "
#~ "sent to \"/devices/thermometers\" topic. To"
#~ " create new devices, you should go"
#~ " back to the devices tab and "
#~ "create a new device, selecting the "
#~ "templates it will be based on, as"
#~ " shown below."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Note that, when you select the "
#~ "template in the right panel at "
#~ "device creation screen, all attributes "
#~ "are inherited from that device. You "
#~ "could add more templates as needed, "
#~ "keeping in mind that templates used "
#~ "to compose a device must not share"
#~ " an attribute with the same name."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As devices are tightly associated to "
#~ "templates, if you want to remove a"
#~ " template, you should remove all its"
#~ " associated devices first. If such "
#~ "thing happens the following error "
#~ "message will appear:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "You can add and remove attributes "
#~ "from templates and they will be "
#~ "immediately available to devices. In "
#~ "case of new attributes being added, "
#~ "though, you should keep in mind "
#~ "that there must not be any device"
#~ " with templates which have attributes "
#~ "with same name. If such thing "
#~ "happens, the following message will "
#~ "appear:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This snapshot was generated by creating"
#~ " a new template (``ExtraTemplate``) with"
#~ " one attribute, called ``level``. Then "
#~ "a new device based on both "
#~ "templates was created and, afterwards a"
#~ " new attribute also called ``level`` "
#~ "was added to ``ThermTemplate``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When this happens, no modification is"
#~ " applied to the template (no "
#~ "attribute named \"level\" related to the"
#~ " \"ThermTemplate\" is created). However, it"
#~ " remains in the template card so "
#~ "the user can figure out what is"
#~ " happening. If the user refreshes the"
#~ " page, it will be reverted to "
#~ "what it was before the modification."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Now the physical devices can send "
#~ "messages to dojot. There are few "
#~ "things to pay attention to: as we"
#~ " defined the MQTT topic (all devices"
#~ " will send to ``/devices/thermometer`` "
#~ "topic), the devices must identify "
#~ "themselves using the ``client-id`` "
#~ "parameter from MQTT protocol. Another "
#~ "way of doing that is to just "
#~ "use the default topic scheme (which "
#~ "is ``/{SERVICE}/{DEVICE_ID}/attrs``."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Just for the sake of simplicity, "
#~ "we'll emulate one device using "
#~ "mosquitto_pub tool. We set the "
#~ "``client-id`` parameter by using the "
#~ "``-i`` flag of mosquitto_pub."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Now that we've created the sensors, "
#~ "let's create a virtual one. This "
#~ "will be the representation of a "
#~ "alarm system that will be triggered "
#~ "whenever something bad is detected to"
#~ " these sensors. Let's say they are"
#~ " installed in a kitchen. So it "
#~ "is expected that their temperature "
#~ "readings will be no more than 40C."
#~ " If it is more than that, our"
#~ " simple detection system will conclude "
#~ "that the kitchen is on fire. This"
#~ " alarm representation will have two "
#~ "attributes: one for a severity level "
#~ "for a particular alarm and another "
#~ "one for a textual message, so that"
#~ " the user is properly informed of "
#~ "what's happening."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Just as for \"regular devices\", virtual"

#~ msgid "Flow configuration"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Once we've created the virtual device,"
#~ " we can add a flow to implement"
#~ " the logic behind the alarm "
#~ "generation. The idea is: if the "
#~ "temperature reading is less than 40, "
#~ "then the alarm system will be "
#~ "updated with a notification of severity"
#~ " 4 (mildly important) and a message"
#~ " indicating that the kitchen is OK."
#~ " Otherwise, if the temperature is "
#~ "higher than 40, then a notification "
#~ "is sent with severity 1 (highest "
#~ "severity) and a message indicating that"
#~ " the kitchen is on fire. This "
#~ "is done as shown belown."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Note that the \"change\" nodes have "
#~ "a reference to an \"output\" entity. "
#~ "This can be thought as a simple"
#~ " data structure - it will have "
#~ "a ``message`` and a ``severity`` "
#~ "attributes that match those from the "
#~ "virtual device. This \"object\" is "
#~ "referenced in the output node as a"
#~ " data source for the device to "
#~ "be updated (in this case, the "
#~ "virtual device we've created). In other"
#~ " words, you can think of this "
#~ "as a piece of information carried "
#~ "from \"change\" nodes to the \"virtual"
#~ " device\" with names \"msg.output.message\" "
#~ "and \"msg.output.severity\", where \"message\" "
#~ "and \"severity\" are the virtual device"
